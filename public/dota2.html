      <h2>Dota 2</h2>
      <p>
        The most-played game on Steam.
        Every day, millions of players worldwide enter battle as one of over a
        hundred Dota heroes. And no matter if it's their 10th hour of play or 1,000th,
        there's always something new to discover. With regular updates that ensure a
        constant evolution of gameplay, features, and heroes, Dota 2 has truly taken on a
        life of its own.

        One Battlefield. Infinite Possibilities.
        When it comes to diversity of heroes, abilities, and powerful items,
        Dota boasts an endless array—no two games are the same. Any hero can fill
        multiple roles, and there's an abundance of items to help meet the needs of
        each game. Dota doesn't provide limitations on how to play, it empowers you to
        express your own style.

        All heroes are free.
        Competitive balance is Dota's crown jewel, and to ensure everyone is
        playing on an even field, the core content of the game—like the vast pool of
        heroes—is available to all players. Fans can collect cosmetics for heroes and
        fun add-ons for the world they inhabit, but everything you need to play is already
        included before you join your first match.

        Bring your friends and party up.
        Dota is deep, and constantly evolving, but it's never too late to join.
        Learn the ropes playing co-op vs. bots. Sharpen your skills in the hero demo mode.
        Jump into the behavior- and skill-based matchmaking system that ensures you'll
        be matched with the right players each game.

        Dota 2 deserves its intimidating reputation, and it probably won’t suit you if you’re
        looking to play casually.
        There’s a huge time investment before you can even enjoy a game, let alone feel competent
        at it.
        But once you start to learn its secrets, there’s a wild and exciting variety of play here
        that’s unmatched, even by its peers.

        It’s a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush. The fact that
        it’s completely and totally free to play in the way we wish all free-to-play games could
        be isn’t just one of the most generous propositions anywhere in gaming, it creates a level
        playing field where skill and cooperation is paramount. May the best team win.

        "You learn how to learn, how to lose and most importantly you learn about you."
        <br>
        Alright.... so here is my dota 2 review after playing almost 6000 hours over the span of 3
        years.
        <br>
        1. general thoughts and how i started:
        I was 15 when a friend recommended dota 2 to me. Back then i wouldnt ever have imagined
        how much time this game would take from me. At some point i was playing 12+ hours a day
        for weeks. Now im approaching my 19th birthday and im kind of conflicted on what kind of
        impact this game had on my life. I learned a lot about myself and generally speaking
        matured a lot regarding interacting with other humans. Dota isnt just a game, Dota is
        something else, something i have never experienced even when i was addicted to a mmorpg
        when i was 9-13. You learn how to learn, how to improve, how to win and how to lose. The
        most important thing dota teached me was how emotions impact your performance, and that
        saying "nothing" is sometimes the best thing to do. In real life no one really teaches you
        stuff like that since people are kind of used to dealing with emotional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.
        <br>
        2. Did i waste my youth?:
        So this sounds a bit depressing but this is a thought that i had sometimes. but
        realisticially speaking, knowing myself, im really unsure of how much my life wouldve been
        different if i never started dota. I asume i wouldve been a bit further regarding social
        contacts but career/school-wise i highly doubt that it wouldve made a big difference. You
        gotta be realistic when thinking about stuff like this. Im not a very social guy. I dont
        like to put work into stuff i dont care about. The thoughts "lets learn music" or "lets
        study" wouldnt have EVER crossed my mind when i was 15. Im pretty sure if i wouldnt have
        started with dota i wouldve just been gooning around the city and abuse drugs, since thats
        a lot of fun to me. Back then i actually never even thought about working on something to
        improve, that whole dimension of "improving" wasnt even there for me. I just went to
        school got home and did fun stuff sometimes. Thats it. No goals. No aspiration, nothing.
        Dota changed that.
        <br>
        3. time invested into dota2:
        EVERY dota player that has spent more than 1000 hours into this game has had that thought
        of "oh man i shouldve learned something with this time.... i couldve been amazing now.."
        at some point. But everyone is disregarding the fact that grinding dota is something VERY
        EASY and comfortable to do, unlike studying or learning an instrument. Just think about
        what kind of game dota 2 is that spending 1000s of hours is something you do with
        pleasure. It's kind of insane thinking about it. Once i started studying more for school
        again i realized how much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time 100 hours is. I garantue you that you will be a top
        student if youd put 20 hours a week into studying outside of school. But the big
        difference is that dota is just so much more fun and REWARDING.
        <br>
        REWARDING: dota 2 is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ REWARDING. you learn a new hero -> BAMM MMR. you start
        understanding how to farm -> M . M . R
        <br>
        YOUR RANK GOES ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ UP. IT FEELS AMAZING. at school you get an A and you smile for
        about 10 minutes and then youre back to being miserable. theres no punishment for being
        mediocre. At least thats how i feel right now and im graduating this year(grades are
        OK(kinda good, not great)).
        <br>
        ReasoN I WROTE THIS: im downloading dota right now because my laptop is REALLY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up
        adn deletes files something, so i needed something to do
        CONCLUSION: AMAZING GAME, EATS ALL YOUR TIME, YOU WILL HAVE FUN(if you are competetive)

        DotA 2 Will drain you of your will to keep playing, and yet you will always return.
        DotA 2 Will make you regret ever playing it, and yet you will always think "Just one more
        game"
        DotA 2 Will take away all your free time, and yet you'll almost feel proud of how many
        hours you have in DotA 2.
        <br>
        With the time you spend on this game, you could do all sorts. Study on learning a new set
        of skills to further your career. You could raise money for charity. You could be an aid
        worker for a foreign country and help improve the lives of others. You could even just
        play other games, you know, those ones sitting in your backlog, pushed aside by DotA 2.
        <br>
        But you won't.
        You will always return to this game. The maximum you will learn from playing this game is
        how to insult others in various languages (mostly these languages will consist of Russian
        and Peruvian.). This game will become as much a part of your life as eating or blinking.
        Half the time you will not even remember having played DotA 2 on a certain day. It just
        becomes natural to you.
        <br>
        If you start playing this game, you will become addicted.
        You will also spend obscene amounts of money on cosmetics. A quick chest purchase here, a
        few random items on the market there, and boom. Like me you'll have spent far too much on
        a game which needs no money spent on it. If you start DotA 2, not only will you be
        subjecting yourself to a motivation-destroying hobby, but also subjecting yourself to a
        wallet emptying one too.
        <br>
        tl;dr This game will take away your time, money and patience for others. You will become
        an angry person.
        <br>
        Basically 10/10 GOTY All years
