      "description": "Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) expands upon the team-based action gameplay        that it pioneered when it was launched 19 years ago.        CS: GO features new maps, characters, weapons, and game modes, and delivers updated        versions of the classic CS content (de_dust2, etc.).        Counter-Strike took the gaming industry by surprise when the unlikely MOD became        the most played online PC action game in the world almost immediately after its release        in August 1999, said Doug Lombardi at Valve. For the past 12 years, it has continued to        be one of the most-played games in the world, headline competitive gaming tournaments and        selling over 25 million units worldwide across the franchise. CS: GO promises to expand        on CS' award-winning gameplay and deliver it to gamers on the PC as well as the next        gen consoles and the Mac."
